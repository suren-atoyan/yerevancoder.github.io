Using git for version control allows for powerful collaboration in tech teams. </p>\n<p>I won’t delve into Git’s history and the motivations behind it here as that deserves a post of its own or even a series of posts. Instead, we discuss a simple git feature you might need - squashing commits.  </p>\n<p>I needed to do this yesterday but forgot the command. First Stack Overflow answers were overly complicated for my use case. So here goes a simplified version. </p>\n<p>Let’s say you’ve been working on a feature and just finished. With git, it’s possible to squash previous commits into one. This helps you logically group commits together before sharing with others. Say you’ve been implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">DFS</a> and this is your current <code>git log</code>:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code>* 16e9bbd (HEAD -> master) depth-first search working\n* 36ab519 fix vertex lookup\n* aa264b1 label vertices\n* bcd1838 recursive discovery\n* 3a6eed3 isolate subgraph\n* 7126d8e add topological sort</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Now you want to squash your latest 5 commits into one to have a nice history. </p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code>$ git rebase -i HEAD~5</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>After you run this command your terminal editor will open up with the following:  </p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code>pick 3a6eed3 isolate subgraph\npick bcd1838 recursive discovery\npick aa264b1 label vertices\npick 36ab519 fix vertex lookup\npick 16e9bbd depth-first search working</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Note that while doing interactive rebase, commits are displayed in reverse order.</p>\n<p>Replace the words “pick” with “squash” next to the commits you want to squash into the commit before it. In our case:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code>pick 3a6eed3 isolate subgraph\nsquash bcd1838 recursive discovery\nsquash aa264b1 label vertices\nsquash 36ab519 fix vertex lookup\nsquash 16e9bbd depth-first search working</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Save and close the editor.</p>\n<p>If you’re too lazy to type that or you’re operating on a Commodore 64 and desperately need those additional few bytes, it’s also possible to write “s” for squash and “p” for pick. So the latest snippet is equivalent to:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code>p 3a6eed3 isolate subgraph\ns bcd1838 recursive discovery\ns aa264b1 label vertices\ns 36ab519 fix vertex lookup\ns 16e9bbd depth-first search working</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Git will now give you the opportunity to change your commit message into something more descriptive. For doing that, replace this: </p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code># This is a combination of 5 commits.\n# The first commit\'s message is:\nisolate subgraph\n\n# This is the 2nd commit message:\n\nrecursive discovery\n\n# This is the 3rd commit message:\n\nlabel vertices\n\n# This is the 4th commit message:\n\nfix vertex lookup\n\n# This is the 5th commit message:\n\ndepth-first seach working</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>With just: </p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code>implement depth-first search</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Note that your new commit message line shouldn’t start with <code>#</code> as it’ll be treated as a comment.</p>\n<p><code>git log</code> should then return:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-zsh"><code>* bb26b9d (HEAD -> master) implement depth-first search\n* ea1a7e8 add topological sort</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That’s it! Now you have your commits squashed into one with an easier to navigate history.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Squashing commits with git",date:"December 24, 2017",discussionId:"2017-12-24-squash-commits-with-git"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2017-12-24-squash-commits-with-git/"}}}});
