## _Review_
-----------
We have gone over some big new ideas so far in the course. Now let's
do a specific review so that everyone is on the same minimum level on
some core concepts, ideas. Remember that you need to spend *HOURS*
outside of these lectures, you need to write the code,
understand it and read through documentation
and the links that are provided. Also try reading their `wikipedia`
pages.

Of all the material we've covered so far,
this review focuses on `node` fundamentals and networking ideas.

## _node fundamentals_
----------------------
node is async by default. Recall what programming
itself means, it means we are telling the computer what to do via code.
That also has an idea of time, we want some code to happen after other
code. Like do this first and then do that, writing such code is called
sequential, synchronous code.

Some pretend code:
```
const file_content = read_file('./names.txt', 'r');
const lines = file_content.split('\n');
for (let line of lines) {
  console.log(`Length: of line:${line} is: ${line.length}`);
}
```
This code must do `read_file` before the call to `.split`. After both
finish then it does the `for` loop.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _node fundamentals cont..._
------------------------------

`read_file` is a function which has to read a file, which means it has
to do some input/output. Input/Output, that is reading from physical
hardware, like a harddrive, is really super slow compared to everything
else the computer can be doing.

Think about it, what if `names.txt` is a 300GB sized file? Then
your program will not continue past `read_file` until that function
`returns`, that is until it finishes. This is called a
blocking I/O function call. Everything network related can be
a blocking I/O function call, like reading from a socket.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _node fundamentals cont..._
------------------------------
Modern networked applications are web apps, mobile apps and
they want a lot of resources. To do this traditionally we'd
need to use multiple processes or threads. Both aren't the
easiest options to use. The genius of `node` is that it is
build from the beginning for networked applications, it scales
very very well.

`node` is able to do this by doing `async` coding by default.
async coding means that the code runs in an unknown order if you
were only looking at the source code, it means that something
on line 5 can happen after something on line 10.
	  </script>
	</section>


	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _node fundamentals cont..._
------------------------------
So our previous example would be written in async style as:

```
read_file('./names.txt', 'r', file_contents => {
  const lines = file_content.split('\n');
  for (let line of lines) {
    console.log(`Length: of line:${line} is: ${line.length}`);
  }
});
```
Since reading a file is an I/O (Input/Output) operation, it could potentially
block the program. Because of that a function like `read_file` will
try reading the file and instantly return, that is stop blocking the
main program. `read_file` also registers the callback that we gave as the
3rd argument as the function to call *WHEN* the data does finally arrive.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">

------------------------------
The callback is put onto the event loop. In node that is only one
`JavaScript` thread, which has to do all the JavaScript code and
also go through the event loop's various queues of things to do.
Because of this, it is *EXTREMELY* important that you never block
the thread, that means do something like `while(true) { }` or
a blocking system I/O call, like `sleep(10)`. Blocking the event
loop blocks all kinds of important system timers and library code.

Be sure to read this
[*link*](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v6.x/doc/topics/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick.md),
its straight from `node`'s source code.

## _Networking_
---------------
Networking is whenever we have two or computers talk to one another.
Remember that because the computers are talking to one another over
a wire, like an ethernet cable, or via radio, like WiFi then the
only kind of data they can send is just raw data. This is why many of
the `node` core APIs use the `Buffer` object because `Buffer` is the
most efficient way to hold raw data.

	  <script type="text/template">
## _Networking Cont..._
-----------------------
Networking is made up of several layers with one build on top of
the others. The TCP/IP network stack starts with the *link* layer,
this is like the ethernet cables. On top of the link layer is the IP
layer, this is how we know about individual computers. On top of that
is the TCP layer, that is routing aka making sure that data gets to
a particular computer while going through other computers on the network,
finally the last layer is the Application layer, that is our layer of things
like HTTP(S).
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Networking Cont..._
-----------------------
So conceptually imagine it like this:

```

	   |-----------------
	   | Application Layer <- Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH

	   |-----------------
	   | Transport Layer   <- Examples: TCP, sockets, UDP

	   |-----------------
	   | IP Layer          <- Examples: 192.4.212.4

	   |-----------------
	   | Link Layer        <- Examples: Ethernet cable, WiFi.
```
Each layer builds on top of the one below it. So what's the
difference between `TCP` and `HTTP`? HTTP is built *ON TOP* of
TCP.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Networking Cont..._
-----------------------
Our main programming abstraction used for networking is called a
`socket`. A `socket` is usually implemented at the `C/C++` level
but node gives it to use as an easy to use `JavaScript` object.
A socket is the main way we use programming languages to have
two or more computers talk to each other. We can make different
kinds of sockets, like `TCP` sockets or `UDP` sockets.

Usually we get a `socket` as an argument to our callbacks or we can
make them directly using the `net` module.
