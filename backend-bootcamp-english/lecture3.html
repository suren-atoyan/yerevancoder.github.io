# Module System and the Event Loop

## Edgar Aroutiounian

#### ISTC backend development course, Week-3, Fall 2016
#### Yerevan, Armenia

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Modularity_
--------------------------
Notice something about our programs? They have all been
written as a single file. That is fine for now but as our
projects grow, it will become harder and harder to think
about the code. We need a way to split out our project
into different pieces, this way we can give different
programmers on the team different parts of codebase to work
on.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _module system_
--------------------------------
Many modern programming languages have a notion of a module system,
of a way to organize code, examples include `Python`, `Ruby`, `OCaml`.

Some older languages don't have a module system at all, like `C`, `C++`.

The EcmaScript/JavaScript spec originally did not include a module system
since JavaScript programs were just kept inside a `<script>` tag and were
usually quite short.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _module system cont..._
------------------
EcmaScript6 introduced a new module system for JavaScript.

it looks like:
```
import React from 'react';
```
But `node` introduced a module system before `ES6`
called `commonjs`. `node` modules are more powerful,
they can be parametrized but `ES6` modules allow for
better static analysis. Because this is a backend class,
we will stay focused on `node` modules.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _node modules_
------------------
The module system is super simple in `node` and you might have already
used it.

```
const fs = require('fs');
```

`require` is a function that comes with the `node` runtime environment,
it is not part of the JavaScript language spec. We give `require` a
string and it looks through module loading path. You can know the local
path with
```
$ npm root
```
and the global system wide path with
```
$ npm root -g
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _node modules cont..._
------------

```
const foo_bar = require('fs');
```
Notice that whatever `require` returns is bound to whatever variable
name you give it. It doesn't have to be the same name as the module name.

1. Note that trying to require a module name that doesn't exist will
   raise an exception.
2. JavaScript files automatically create a module but when you require them
   you don't need to add the `.js` extension.
3. We use the module system to create a notion of public/private.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _our own modules_
---------------------
Now we'll make our own modules. Each JavaScript file run by `node`
gets some special variables, `module` and `exports`.
These variables will let us control what things the modules exposes to the
outside world, aka other modules.
	  </script>
	</section>


	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _our own modules..._
------------------------
Imagine this directory structure, each `\` is a directory
```
project
 \
  src
  | first.js
  | second.js
  \
   lib
   | third.js
```
then we can do...

```
// Imagine this is second.js
const first = require('./first');
const another = require('./lib/third');
```
	  </script>
	</section>
	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _our own modules..._
------------------------
So let's finally make modules!

```
// Imagine this is ex.js
exports.name = 'Hello World';
exports.make_upper = str => str.toUpperCase();
exports.fancy = function() {
  console.log(this.name.toUpperCase());
}
```
Then we can load up the `node` repl
```
$ node
> const g = require('./ex');
```
And you can play with it, question, what does `this` bind to in the
`fancy` function? (The `exports` variable is just a JavaScript object.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _our own modules..._
------------------------
Note that the module only exposes what was explicitly assigned to
`exports`. This way we provide a public interface, everything not
assigned to `exports` is hidden. This is how we do public/private in
`node`.
```
// Imagine this is ex.js

// This fat arrow function, func, is only visible inside the module.
// other modules can't see it, can't use it directly.
const func = () => console.log('Some silly function');

exports.name = 'Hello World';
exports.make_upper = str => str.toUpperCase();
exports.fancy = function() {
  func();
  console.log(this.name.toUpperCase());
};
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _our own modules..._
------------------------
Notice that we had to use `exports` for each value we wanted
exposed. There is a nice short cut by using the `module` variable.

```
// Image this is ex.js
const some_hidden_value = 'barev';
module.exports = {
  name : 'name',
  make_upper : str => str.toUpperCase(),
  // Notice we use the short cut for defining functions
  // in a JavaScript object literal
  fancy() {
    console.log(some_hidden_value);
    console.log(this.name.toUpperCase());
  }
};
```
And the usage is the exact same:
```
$ node
> require('./ex').make_upper('hello')
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _our own modules..._
------------------------

And here is how `node` modules are more powerful than
`ES6` modules, you can paramertize them, that is make custom modules
based on given values.

```
// Imagine called ex.js
module.exports = param => {
  switch(param) {
  case 'special':
    return {spot: 10, names : ['hello', 'world']};
  default:
    return {spot : -10, names : []};
  }
};
```

```
$ node
> require('./ex')();
> require('./ex')('special');
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _Some Notes about modules in node_
-------------------------------------
1. modules in node are `cached`, that means that
   you get the same value on `require` each time you load it.
   If you want the module to be freshly loaded each time you use
   it with `require` then do the `module.exports = <a function>`
   trick that was shown previously.

2. All the modules that come with node, aka the standard library
   and offically called `node core` are compiled into the `node`
   binary, like `fs` and `http`. You can look at their documentation
   [here.](https://nodejs.org/api/)

3. Even if you name your file `http.js` and try to load it
   with `require('http')`, node will still pick its core module.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _The Event Loop_
--------------------
`node` runs its event loop on a single thread of execution.
This means that everything we do in `node` ends up
only running on one thread, there is no real multithreading.
Is this a problem? Not really, because `node` was designed for networked
application which are blocked most of the time anyway because of
Input/Output (IO). The key point in `node` is to NEVER EVER block the event
loop, this means things like `sleep` are bad ideas and doing CPU intensive
tasks is a bad idea (Like numerical analysis, calcuating primes, multiplying
matrixes).
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _The Event Loop cont..._
----------------------------
Recall that `node` is built on top of `V8`, Google's JavaScript
interpreter. But `node` is also built using
the [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) library, this is a
cross platform asynchronous I/O library. This is a `C` library
that `node` is linked against and it creates several threads in a thread
pool which are used by by the IO calls.

`node` uses a model of programming called `event-based` programming.
You kind of already know about it, every GUI program is written in
an `event-based` style. This means that you say what code should run
when a certain even happens.

example: When the mouse clicks the button, what should happen.
	  </script>
	</section>

  <section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _The Event Loop cont..._
----------------------------

Conceptually things run like this:

<img src="https://images.contentful.com/hspc7zpa5cvq/understanding-the-nodejs-event-loop-diagram/71a2cfa55079ce73bbde6f3e9504f1d5/understanding-the-nodejs-event-loop-diagram.png"/>

Each run around this cycle is called a 'tick', you can register a
function for the next go around the loop with `process.nextTick`

Understand this picture, if you think about it then it should
then be clear why you can't get exact times in your timer based
code.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _The Event Loop cont..._
----------------------------
`node` makes it easy to deal with the this using
the `EventEmitter` object.

```
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const util = require('util');

function MyThing() {
  EventEmitter.call(this);
  setImmediate(emitThing1, this);
}

util.inherits(MyThing, EventEmitter);

function emitThing1(self) {
  self.emit('thing1');
}

const mt = new MyThing;

mt.on('thing1', function onThing1() {
  console.log('did some code');
});
```
--> Make sure that we explain all of this <--

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _The Event Loop cont..._
----------------------------
Why you should never block the loop

```
const EE = require('events').EventEmitter;
const ee = new EE;
let die = false;

ee.on('die', function() {
  die = true;
});

setTimeout(function() {
  ee.emit('die');
}, 1000);

while(!die) { }

console.log('done');
```

What's wrong with this code?

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _The Event Loop cont..._
----------------------------

Notice that the timeout never goes off, even though it
looks like it should. It never gets to because the event
loop thread never gets to make progress, that is it can't
go around the loop again. (Recall the picture we
showed earlier, the event loop doesn't get to check
all the registered timer functions).

so let me make this clear:
NEVER BLOCK THE THREAD
