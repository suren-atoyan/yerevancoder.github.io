## _Programming Languages_
--------------------------
Programming languages generally fall into two categories,

1. Compiled
2. Interpreted

Examples of (1) include **C**, **C++** and **OCaml**

Examples of (2) include **Python**, **JavaScript** and **Ruby**

(Java isn't exactly 1 or 2 as it compiles to Java bytecode and
then it's interpreted by the JVM)
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Short History of JavaScript_
--------------------------------
The first web browser was called
[**Mosaic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)
and the web itself was made so that physicists could share
research papers. Research papers are static content,
that is they don't change. Think about your HTML,
it doesn't change.

Then businesses discovered the web and immediately interactively was
needed. People needed the websites to do things, to take credit cards,
to animate things, to change the site; for that you need a real
programming language.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Short History of JavaScript, cont..._
-----------------------------------------
There was a race to provide a programming language for the web.
[Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) at NetScape,
now at Mozilla, rushed and in eight days created **JavaScript**.
At the time NetScape was in competition with Microsoft and Microsoft
also created a programming language for the web, it was
called **VBScript**

(Because JavaScript was made in only eight days, the
language has some serious mistakes)

One of the reasons why JavaScript won and VBScript died is the former
is open-source and the latter was closed source. This is why JavaScript is also
known as **EcmaScript**, there is an open spec, standard.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _Engines_
-------------
An engine is another name for an interpreter, remember
that JavaScript is interpreted, not compiled. The first JavaScript engine,
written by Eich, was **SpiderMonkey**, it is
implemented in **C++** and still used in **FireFox** Today there are
quite a few JS engines,

1. SpiderMonkey, used in FireFox
2. Chakra, used in Edge
3. JavaScriptCore, used in Safari, Mobile Safari,
   ReactNative, original version of Chrome
4. V8, created by Google, used in Chrome and the
   foundation of **nodejs**

...and more
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _nodejs_
------------
In this course we will be using **nodejs**, also just known as
**node**, and the latest version of JavaScript called EcmaScript 6 (ES6).
This is so that you know the latest technologies used in Silicon Valley.

**node** was made in 2009 by an amazing programmer named Ryan Dahl,
he basically took **V8**, added an event loop and some low-level IO
calls. Since then the project has taken off and now node is used by
basically all startups and big name users like Groupon, IBM, LinkedIn,
Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, SAP, Walmart, Yahoo!, Cisco Systems and many more.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _nodejs cont..._
--------------------
We are learning on the latest versions of node,
which support the majority of ES6 (EcmaScript 6). You can play with the
node repl at any time by starting it on the command line:

```
$ node
> var a = 10;
undefined
```
I encourage you to always test out ideas directly in the **node** repl, keep
one terminal always running the **node** repl and another terminal for
running JavaScript code from a file.

	  </script>
	</section>


	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _Installation notes_
------------------------
node works on all the major platforms, Windows, Linux, OS X; we work on Linux.
if on a Debian or Debian downstream project like Ubuntu you can do:
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo bash -
$ sudo aptitude install nodejs -y
```

we also use the `Atom` text editor

```
$ wget https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.15.0/atom-amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
$ sudo npm install tern -g
$ apm install react atom-ternjs
```

	  </script>
	</section>
	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _Installation notes cont..._
---------------------------------
Then you can make JavaScript programs by making a JavaScript file with `Atom`
```
$ atom code.js
```
And run the code:
```
$ node code.js
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: variables_
-----------------
Every programming language has **variables**. A variable, also called
an identifier, is way to refer to data in memory. Fundamental data types
in JavaScript include **String**, **Boolean**, **Number** and others.

Note that comments, aka non runnable code, start with **//**

Example:

```
// Creates a variable called a with the data 123, the type of
// a is Number
var a = 123;

// Creates a variable called name with the data 'Student'
// the type of name is String
var name = 'Student';
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: variables cont..._
-----------------------------------

**NOTE** Every language also has `keywords`, these are words that you cannot use
as identifiers, they are reserved for the language itself, examples: `if`, `for`,
`var`, `function`, and more.


Notice that our variables that we created started with `var`
In ES6, EcmaScript 6, we have three ways of declaring variables.

```
var a = 10;
const b = 'hello';
let g = true;
```

What is the difference between the three?
For that we need to talk about scope.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope_
-----------------------
Scope is a fundamental idea in all programming languages and it's especially
important in JavaScript. It basically means where it's legal to use a variable.
In ES6 scopes are introduced by `blocks`, some examples of things that
introduce blocks include conditionals, loops, and functions.

```
// imagine that this file is called prog.js
if (true) {
  var name = '123';
}
// we can print anything to the terminal screen with console.log
console.log(name);
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------
if we try running the previous code:
```
$ node prog.js
```
Then we'll see that '123' is printed to the screen. Here we say that
the conditional leaks scope, the variable `name` is escaping the scope.
Now if we try using `let`, then we'll see a difference:
```
// imagine that this file is called prog.js
if (true) {
  let name = '123';
}
// we can print anything to the terminal screen with console.log
console.log(name);
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------
if we try running the code that used `let`:
```
$ node prog.js
```
Then we get an `exception`, a fatal error not handled by you
```
ReferenceError: name is not defined

```

	  </script>
	</section>
	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------

As programmers we ALWAYS need to read the error messages. The error message here
tells you that the variable is not defined, that is, its not in scope. Why? Because
we created the variable `name` with `let` and variables created with `let` are
scoped to the `block` in which they are created. that is, you're only allowed
to use that variable in the block that you created it in. Another example:
```
// Silly for loop.
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
console.log(i);
}
console.log(i)
```
Here we make a variable `i` which we made only to do a loop three times
but its still accessible, usable outside the loop.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------
We always want to scope variables as close as possible to their usage,
their actual needs. Another modifier is `const`. Now we need to talk
about mutation.
```
let a = 'Karen';
a = 'Հասմիկ';
```
What happened? We changed, we **mutated**, the variable from the string 'Karen'
to the new string 'Հասմիկ'. Also notice that we only have to use the `let` modifier
the first time we make the variable.
	  </script>
	</section>

      <section data-markdown>
	    <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------
What if we don't want the variable to change?
For that we use `const`
```
const a = 'Karen';
a = 'Հասմիկ';
```
`exception`:
```
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  at repl:1:3
  at realRunInThisContextScript (vm.js:22:35)
  at sigintHandlersWrap (vm.js:98:12)
  at ContextifyScript.Script.runInThisContext (vm.js:24:12)
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
--------------------------------
So `const` is like `let` semantically, aka the meaning of how it's used
and scoping but with the additional benefit that variables made with
`const` are not allowed to be reassigned. The final one, `var`, is function scoped.

It is important to understand this fundamental concept of scope.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: control structure_
-----------------------------------
Now we will talk about control structure, for the moment we will focus on
synchronous code, that is code that executes top to down. That is node will read
your code from the beginning to end and do everything that you tell it to do.
We've seen two control structures already, the `if` conditional and the `for` loop.

```
// Inside the () needs to be a boolean expression
// something that evaluates to true or false.
if (10 > 5) {
  console.log('Hello world');
}
```
`for` loops
```
for (let j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
  console.log(j + 5);
}
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: control structure cont..._
-------------------------------------------
Control structures help us structure, organize our code, which way
it should 'go', what it should do.

The conditional can also take an `else`
```
if (5 < 3) {
  console.log('This is impossible);
} else {
  console.log('Of course 5 is not less than 3');
}
```
Another loop construct is the `while` control structure.
```
let i = 0;
while (i < 4) {
  console.log('Keep talking');
  // i++ is short for i = i + 1;
  i++
}
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Arrays, Sets, Maps, Objects_
---------------------------------
Now we need to talk about containers. A container is something that contains other
things! Let's say we want to talk about all the students in the classroom, how
can we use one variable to talk about all those students? The easiest way is to
use something an `array`.

```
let students = ['Միքայել', 'Gohar', 'Владимир'];
```
`students` is an array and its size is three.
You can make an array by using `[]`, for example
```
let emp = []
```
makes a variable `emp` which starts as an empty array.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Arrays, Sets, Maps, Objects cont..._
-----------------------------------------
We can access elements in the arrays by indexing.

```
// Arrays start from a 0 index.
//               0          1            2
let students = ['Միքայել', 'Gohar', 'Владимир'];
console.log(students[1]);
```
If you try to access an element out of bounds, out of the range of the
array then you get `undefined` (A mistake in the language)
```
console.log(students[42]);
```
And that will print undefined to the terminal screen.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Arrays, Sets, Maps, Objects cont..._
-----------------------------------------
Objects in JavaScript are a way to keep keys and values. Think of a phonebook,
we want to say someone's name is associated with a mobile number.

```
const friends = {Gevorg: '09-34231', Sammy: '08-23123'};
console.log(friends.Gevorg);
console.log(friends['Sammy']);
```

We make JavaScript objects with `{}` and pairs of keys, values.
So `Gevorg` is a key and its value is `'09-34231'`. The size of our
`friends` object is two.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Arrays, Sets, Maps, Objects cont..._
-----------------------------------------
We can loop over arrays; using the old style for loop.
```
const students = ['Միքայել', 'Gohar', 'Владимир'];
for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
  console.log(students[i]);
}
```
Notice that the `students` variable as a property called length. A property is
anything that can be accessed with `.` of an identifier. I recommend that for that kind of
logic you use the new style for loop.
```
const students = ['Միքայել', 'Gohar', 'Владимир'];
// If we don't want to mutate s, then we use const, otherwise use let
for (const s of students) {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
}
```
	  </script>
	</section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Arrays, Sets, Maps, Objects cont..._
-----------------------------------------------
if you need to make sure that you have a collection of only unique things, then
you need to use a `Set`

```
// iterable will only have the elements 1 2 3
const iterable = new Set([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]);
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Arrays, Sets, Maps, Objects cont..._
-----------------------------------------------------
Another collection type is called `Map`. Maps are new in EcmaScript 6

```
const iterable = new Map([["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]);
for (const [key, value] of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
```

Notice that there's a common theme, having an ability to go over
one thing at a time of a collection. This is called `iterating` over
a collection.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Functions_
---------------------------
Notice how we've been writing the code. We've been just writing
it at the top level, at the file level. The code is not **reusable**.

To fix that, we use **functions**. A function is a block of code that
runs whenever we **call** the function. Functions are also values in
JavaScript which means that we can put them in variables, in arrays.

This is very powerful, some programming languages do not accept
functions as values, for example Java.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Functions cont..._
-----------------------------------

Here is a simple example, we make a function, assign it to
the constant variable `speaker` and then call the variable
as a function. Note that variables inside a function are
block scoped and will be deleted after the function returns,
aka finishes.

```
const speaker = function() {
  console.log('Hello world');
};

speaker();
```
functions in JavaScript don't have to explicitly give back a value.
If you don't have a `return` then the function gives back `undefined`
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Functions cont..._
-----------------------------------

Functions can take data, we call that data the **parameters** of
the function.

```
const speaker = function(param) {
  console.log(param);
};

const s = 'Hello World';
speaker(s);
```
The actual data given to the function is called its **arguments**.
Here we called the variable speaker as a function with the
argument `s` which was a variable for the data `'Hello World'`.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Functions cont..._
-----------------------------------
JavaScript functions are also **vararg** functions, that means that
the functions can take as many arguments as given, even if the
function has less parameters than the number of arguments given to it.

```
const speaker = function(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1);
  console.log(param2);
}
// Not an error
speaker('Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz', 'Catz');
```
All the arguments given to a function are stored in the variable
`arguments`, it is only accessible inside a function scope.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Functions cont..._
-----------------------------------
Modern `ES6` lets you collect all the arguments in a variable using `...`
```
const speaker = function(param1, param2, ...rest) {
  // param1 is 'Foo', param2 is 'Bar'
  // ...rest is an array with 'Baz', 'Catz'
  console.log(param1);
  console.log(param2);
}
speaker('Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz', 'Catz');
```
You can also provide default values
```
const speaker = function(param1, param2='World') {
  console.log(param1 + param2);
}
speaker('Hello');
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: execution context_
-------------------------------------------
One of the hardest things to understand in JavaScript is
the `this` variable, also known as the execution context.

The `this` variable refers to the current `object`.

```
const obj = {
  name: 'mari',
  speak: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
obj.speak();
```
The `this` variable is **dynamically** scoped, this means that it's
changed and doesn't use the data that you might think it does when
you use it.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: execution context cont..._
-------------------------------------------
The `this` variable is a part of the `EcmaScript` spec, that means
that it's part of the language but its implementation depends on what
environment you're running your JavaScript code in. In the browser it
refers to the `window` object, in `node` it refers to the global object.
Open the `node` repl and type `this`, you'll see the global object printed.
```
$ node
> this
{ DTRACE_NET_SERVER_CONNECTION: [Function],
  DTRACE_NET_STREAM_END: [Function],
  DTRACE_HTTP_SERVER_REQUEST: [Function],
  DTRACE_HTTP_SERVER_RESPONSE: [Function],
  DTRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_REQUEST: [Function],
  DTRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_RESPONSE: [Function],
  global: [Circular],
  process:
  process {
    title: 'node',
```
	  </script>
	</section>


	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: execution context cont..._
-------------------------------------------
JavaScript functions also have methods on them and the most
important ones are `bind`, `call`, and `apply`.

Another way to call a function
```
const f = function(g) { console.log(g)}
// call just takes all the arguments you give it
// and passes it to the function you are calling with .call
f.call(null, 'hello')
```
You can also use `.apply` but for apply you need to give an
array of arguments.
```
const f = function(g, h) { console.log(g + h)}
f.apply(null, ['hello', 'world'])
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: execution context cont..._
-------------------------------------------
Notice that for both `.call` and `.apply` we gave `null`.
This means that we aren't going to provide a custom execution context,
that the function will get to use whatever the `this` variable would
have been. Now we will control the execution context:

```
const obj = {
  name: 'mari',
  speak: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
const other_obj = { name:'nane' };
obj.speak.call(other_obj);
```
Run this code and you'll see that `nane` is printed to the screen, not `mari`.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: execution context cont..._
-------------------------------------------
Now we will talk about the most powerful and important
method on functions, `.bind`. The big annoyance in
JavaScript is that the execution context, the `this`
variable that you end up using at runtime is not always
the one you think will be used. This is because the `this`
variable is `dynamically` scoped, not `lexically` scoped.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: execution context cont..._
-------------------------------------------
To make sure that our function uses the execution
content that we want used we have to use `.bind`.

`.bind` creates a new function that uses the execution context
that you provide.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: execution context cont..._
-------------------------------------------

```
const obj = {
  name:'aram'
};
// At the top level this refers to the global object
this.name = 'gohar';
const g = function(last_name) {
// This is using ES6 string interpolation, aka the ${}
  return `${this.name.toUpperCase()} ${last_name}`;
}
const f = g.bind(obj)
console.log(f('baz'));
```

So `f` is a new function which is bound, we did a bind on g,
to the JavaScript object `obj`.

We can also do other wacky things with `.bind` like partial
function application.

### _JavaScript: execution context cont..._
-------------------------------------------
Partial function application is like making a new function
from another function but where some of the arguments are used
with other values; its clearer with an example.

```
const obj = {
  name:'aram'
};
// At the top level this refers to the global object
this.name = 'gohar';
const g = function(last_name, age) {
  return `${this.name} ${last_name} ${age}`;
}
// The first argument must always be the new execution context
// and the other arguments end up being the
// arguments of the original function
const f = g.bind(obj, 'baz');
console.log(f(22));
```
See how `'baz'` ends up taking the argument value of `last_name`,
this is positional.

### _JavaScript: Fat Arrows_
----------------------------
Now we're going to talk about a new feature of the
JavaScript langauge, part of ES6, called `fat arrows`.

Fat arrow functions are like regular functions except
for some syntax differences and what execution context
they use; they use the `this` variable from its lexical scope.

We will be using them extensively, they are
very fun.

	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Fat Arrows cont..._
------------------------------------
```
const f = function(first, second) {
  return first + second;
}
```

is the same thing as:

```
const g = (first, second) => {
  return first + second;
}
```
Notice that we don't have to write `function`, less typing
for us and we use `=>`

	  </script>
	</section>

### _JavaScript: Fat Arrows cont..._
------------------------------------
if your function takes only one parameter, then you don't
need `()` for the parameter list.

```
const g = name => {
  return `Hi: ${name.toUpperCase()}`;
}
```
If the function is only one expression, then you don't need
`{}` or even `return`
```
const g = name => `Hi: ${name.toUpperCase()}`;
```
This makes it super fun to use fat arrow functions with things like
`.map` and `.filter`.

```
const evens = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
```
	  </script>

### _JavaScript: Objects again_
-------------------------------
Notice that we made objects directly, JavaScript objects are
the way to make new data types.

The way to make new data types is to use....functions!

Will this work? Try it.

```
const Person = function(first_name, last_name) {
  this.f_name = first_name;
  this.l_name = last_name;
  this.speak = function() {
    console.log(`My name is: ${this.f_name} ${this.l_name}`);
  }
}
const armo = Person('famous', 'gampr');
armo.speak();
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Objects again_
-------------------------------
The previous example didn't work because it matters **how** we
call a function, do we call it as a **function** or
like a **constructor**. In the previous example we
called Person like a function and so the
execution that it used ended up being the global object because the
function wasn't bound to a particular `this` variable and so it kept
looking up in the scope chain until it found one. You can think of
this like doing `cd ..` in the shell, eventually
you will hit `/` and you can't go any higher than `/`, similiarly
the global `this` variable is always available. Check `this.f_name`,
you'll see it has 'famous' attached to it, not a good thing.

(fat arrows can't be called as constructors)

### _JavaScript: Objects again․․․_
-------------------------------
So we need to make sure that we get a **new** execution context
when we call the function, we need to call the function as a constructor

```
const Person = function(first_name, last_name) {
  // if this is now called as a constructor, that is
  // if called used `new` then `this` is just an empty
  // JavaScript object, its {} and here we are assigning
  // new properties to it.
  this.f_name = first_name;
  this.l_name = last_name;
  this.speak = function() {
    console.log(`My name is: ${this.f_name} ${this.l_name}`);
  }
}
const armo = new Person('famous', 'gampr');
armo.speak();
```

	  </script>
	</section>
	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Classes_
-------------------------------
Notice that it wasn't an error to call the function
as a constructor or as a function, `node` was okay
with either, you only got an error when you tried to
use a property that didn't exist.

A convention emerged that functions with uppercase names
were meant to be called as constructors.

This was still error prone so ES6 introduced `classes`․

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: Classes cont..._
---------------------------------

```
class person {
  constructor(name, last_name) {
    this.f_name = name;
    this.last_name = last_name;
  }
  speak () {
    console.log(`My name is : ${this.f_name} ${this.last_name});
  }
}
const gor = new person('gor', 'gampr');
gor.speak();
```
Notice, if we don't call person with `new` then we'll
get an TypeError exception.
